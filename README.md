Enex -> Markdown
================

Evernote has a handy note export, but it exports to an XML file.

This script converts that enex to a directory of markdown formatted notes.

# Usage

* `git clone git@github.com:seanhagen/enex-to-markdown`
* `cd enex-to-markdown`
* `bundle install`
* put your export notes file in a file named 'notes.enex'
* `ruby parse.rb`

That's it! Your notes will show up in the 'notes' folder.
